I've tried lot's of c++ IDEs on MacOS X, but none of them is as powerful as VS Studio on Windows. It's always hard for me to choose an IDE before I want to write some code, as it's called the *Selection phobia*. Generally we have the following choose:

* Vim/Emacs (I'm familiar with VIM but it's still not an easy way, for me)
* CodeBlocks (not good maintained on MacOS)
* CodeLite (it's a good choose!)
* XCode (I just don't like it, **Heavy** and ugly, can't get used to it)
* QT Creator (it's useful especially when developing Qt projects)
* Eclipse CDT
* NetBeans
* CLion (maybe the best c++ IDE on MaxOS, unfortunately does not have a free version)
* Textmate

Recently I tried Visual Studio Code, it's really a good choose for those who want to write some c++ code in a lightweight IDE.

# Setup Visual Studio Code for C++ development

First we have to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and a few extensions:

* C/C++
* Easy C++ projects

After installed those extensions, reload the editor to activate them. Now we can create a project:

* Choose File > Open folder to open a work directory
* Press F1 and type "c++", then select "Create new C++ project" command.

After the above steps a new project with Makefile is generated.

# Common usage
To debug or run the project, just click the button on the bottom status bar, it's easy:

to run other commands, you could just press F1 and guess, for example, to format the code, just search "format" and then you got a choice.


# Update: How to setup eclipse CDT in MacOX

Recently I tried to use eclipse-cdt with cmake build system, there are a few tips:

* Need to install `cmake` and `ninjia`
* Need to start eclipse from command line, this is a [bug](https://www.wfbsoftware.de/2019/01/12/eclipse-cdt-c-cmake-on-mac/)

In order to debug, basiclly eclipse only supports gdb, which is has been replaced with lldb in MacOS, so a few setps needed to make it working:

* install gdb via mac ports, `sudo port install gdb`
* after installed, it's located in `/opt/local/bin/ggdb`
* create an alias for gdb in your bash profile(eg. `~/.zshrc`), `alias gdb=ggdb`
* codesign for gdb, following [How to setup gdb and Eclipse to debug C++ files on macOS Mojave](https://www.thomasvitale.com/how-to-setup-gdb-and-eclipse-to-debug-c-files-on-macos-sierra/)
* create gdb init file: `echo "set startup-with-shell off" > ~/gdbinit`
* need to start eclipse from terminal, otherwise it will not recongnize gdb
