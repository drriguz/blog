很多人，如同我的同事，似乎觉得lombok这玩意就像神一样的存在，“极大”的方便了项目的开发。我个人是不喜欢这玩意的，很简单的理由：

* 生成getter/setter不是多么困难的事情，IDE很简单就能帮你搞定
* 我不喜欢为自己的IDE装一大堆插件，还要为项目手动开启一下Annotation Processing
* 代码不可见，意味着生成的getters/setter方法，以及@AllArgConstructor生成的方法无法维护

当我把这些想法告诉同事的时候，同事们都觉得我脑子有问题，理由不充分，”lombok只是一个工具，只是没有找到使用工具的最佳实践“。实际上对于技术人员来说，想说服别人是很困难的事情，然而我们为什么要试图说服别人呢？没有多大的意义。相比于工具，有一些更重要的东西就是：经验和原则。

就我的经验，能简单的事情就不要复杂化，越是复杂越难以维护。当然也有人和我是相同的观点，看了一些有意思的关于为什么不用lombok的讨论，贴出来看看：

> OK, let me put it one more time: this has caused me too many bugs. Let me tell

> On one project, a new version of the Lombok plugin caused the IDE to

> another project, Lombok made the CI server crash (and would have
> probably caused the production server to crash), as it triggered a bug
> in the JVM On a third project, we achieved 30% performance increase by
> recoding the equals/hashcode from Lombok
> -> In those 3 projects, some developer gained 5 minutes, and I spent hours recoding everything. So yes, a bad experience.

> Oh, and I just got 2 more:

> Lombok crashing with MapStruct Lombok making Jacoco fails, which meant
> the project didn't pass the Sonar quality gate
